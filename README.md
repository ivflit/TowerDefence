# TowerDefence Project

This is the code for my tower defence project that I built for my A level computer science project.

## What was the main learning from this

### OOP - c#
Taught myself C# which was not challenging as I was proficient in vb.net beforehand. In this project I used key OOP principles like inheritence, polymorphism and composition


### Pathfinding - Djikstras
I had to research into pathfinding algorithms like A* and Djikstras and had to implement a version of this into my code. As a result, I ended up creating a node map aswell as a tile map to allow for the pathfinding. I had many bugs where the enemies would skip nodes and I managed to solve this by using breakpoints and stepping through the code to see that there was an issue with the queue system.
